			There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For
			instance you can make words <b>bold, important,</b> <i>italicc, emphasized,</i> <small>small...</small>
			<br>
			<mark>the</mark> <del>list </del> <ins>goes</ins> 
			<sub>on</sub> <sup>and</sup> on.
		</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:
		</p>
		<p>
			<blockquote>
    		Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the 
    		<br>
    		change that we seek.
    		</br>

			<h1>Blocks and Inline Elements</h1>
			
			A <span> < div > </span> is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line 
			and take up the full width available.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			And a <span> < span ></span> tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.
