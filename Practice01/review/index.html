            <h1>This is a Heading (h1)</h1>
            <h2>This is a Heading too! (h2)</h2>
            <h3>This is also a Heading! (h3)</h3>

        <p>This is a paragraph (p). Line breaks here: <br>
        and continues...</p>

        There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For
        instance you can make words <b>bold</b>, <strong>important</strong>, <i>italicc</i>, <em>emphasized</em>, <small>small</small>...
        <mark>the</mark> <s>list</s> <u>goes</u> <sub>on</sub> <sup>and</sup> on.
        
        <br>

        You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:
        <blockquote>
            Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other
            time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that
            we seek.
        </blockquote>

        <input placeholder="here's an input field">

            <ul>
                <li>This is a list!</li>
                <li>this kind of list is called an unordered list.</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Ordered Lists!</li>
            <li>As you can see it is marked with numbers.</li>
        </ol>

        
        <div>
            <h1>Blocks and Inline Elements</h1>
        </div>

        <div>
            A &lt; div &gt; is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line and take up the full width available.
        </div>
        <span>
            And a &lt; span &gt; tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.
        </span>

        <div class="headings">
            <h1>Now head over to the version with css and see how powerful css is!</h1>
        </div>
