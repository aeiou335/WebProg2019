    <h1>This is a Heading (h1)</h1>
    <h2>This is a Heading too! (h2)</h2>
    <h3>This is also a Heading! (h3)</h3>
    <h4>This just goes on...</h4>
    <h5>and on..</h5>
    <h6>till h6</h6>
    <p>This is a paragraph (p). Line breaks here: <br>
        and continues...</p>
    <p>There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For
        instance you can make words <b>bold</b>, <strong>important</strong>, <i>italicc</i>, <em>emphasized</em>, <small>small</small>... <br>
        <mark>the</mark> <s>list</s> <u>goes</u> <sub>on</sub> <sup>and</sup> on.</p>

    <p>You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:
        <blockquote>Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other
            time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that
            we seek.</blockquote>

        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/qmCpvEj.jpg"></a><br>
    <form><input type="summit" value="here's an input field"></form>
    <table>
        <caption>This is a table</caption>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Head1</b></td>
            <td><b>Head2</b></td>
            <td><b>Head3</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>This</td>
            <td>Is</td>
            <td>How</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>You</td>
            <td>Create</td>
            <td>Tables</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <ul>
        <li>This is a list!</li>
        <li>this kind of list is called an unordered list.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Ordered Lists!</li>
        <li>As you can see it is marked with numbers.</li>
    </ol>
    <div><h1>Blocks and Inline Elements</h1></div>
    <div>A div is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line 
            and take up the full width available.</div>
    <span>And a span tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.</span>
